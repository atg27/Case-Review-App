This is a medical case review application. This application fetches data from cases on the NIH website. All users are able to view this data. Upon signup and log in, users have full CRUD capability through the app's Ruby on Rails backend and React frontend. Medical cases are presented with titles, images, and impressions. Cases can be saved and created for further review or use. The primary purpose of this application is to provide a resource for those wanting more exposure to radiographic imaging/findings along with associated cases and diagnoses. 

This app uses a React frontend with a Ruby on Rails backend. This application provides Authorization and Authentication using ActiveRecord, Bcrypt and Rails. 

In order to start this application, fork and clone this repo. Navigate into the repo and run "rails s" to run the backend. Use "npm install --prefix client", and then "npm start --prefix client", to run the front end.
